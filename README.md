## Motivations

First personal project repo in a long time. I let the pandemic destroy me. This led to a massive burnout, depression, weight gain, drinking problem... Past 5 years have been a war with self that I have persevered through. Thanks to my wife and my family. I had lost all discipline to do anything. I did not want to code at all, escapism and just so so mentally and physically exhuasted and not being able to get out of bed. This note is a thank you to life and to signal, I AM BACK IN THE GAME.
